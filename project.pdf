The option I have chosen is the first one, a food business website.

I used bootstrap for carousel and navigation bar, links of bootstrap CDN:
https://cdn.staticfile.org/twitter-bootstrap/5.1.1/css/bootstrap.min.css
https://cdn.staticfile.org/twitter-bootstrap/5.1.1/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js

All the images used in this project are from canvas,google images(creative),pinterest and my own drawing, for editing posters I used free online poster template on a website (www.chuangkit.com).

Main functionality of webiste:
1. 'About' page contains a modal with images of foods.
2. 'Contact' page allows clients to give feedback through filling the form. All the feedbacks are stored in a database.
3. 'Order' page allows clients to add food into basket, to change quantity, to remove products from basket and leads to the order placed page when click the pay button.
4. 'Join us' page contains links to linkedIn and gmail.
